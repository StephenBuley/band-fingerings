# Band Fingerings

A project to help beginner band students learn their instrument fingerings.

Go to the [Band Fingerings web app](https://band-fingerings.vercel.app/) to see where we are at!

The idea for this app came from long-time friend, Salem Brackett, who is a band director in Klein ISD in Texas. Thanks Salem!

Currently the functionality is limited to a subset of the fingerings for French Horn, Trumpet, Euphonium, and Three and Four Valve Bb Tubas, but the idea is to extend this project to all wind instruments.
